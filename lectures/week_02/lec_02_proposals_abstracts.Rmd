## General structure | 3 important pieces

1. Title

2. Abstract

3. Body

    - text / narrative  
    - figures / tables  
    - references  
    - budget


## General structure | Title

* Must get the attention of a wide but appropriate range of potential readers.

> - Who is the target audience? What is the funding source? Related to species, region, habitat, taxa?

> - Need not be formal but avoid getting too cute

> - Pros and cons of being specific and general

> - Consider a rough title to help think about the proposal & then refine it later
