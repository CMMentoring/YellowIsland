# Choosing a journal & <br>author guidelines


## Choosing a journal

Things to consider 

> - topic

> - audience

> - reputation or impact factor

> - cost; open access (OA) journals can be $3000+ per article


## Choosing a journal | Topic & audience

Look over the journal's "scope"

For example, [*Can J Fish Aquat Sci*](https://cdnsciencepub.com/journal/cjfas/about)


## Choosing a journal | Reputation

* Do you read articles in this journal?

> - Do people you know publish in this journal?

> - Are the articles you cite published in this journal?


## Choosing a journal | Reputation

* What is known about the editorial process?

> - Is the editorial office friendly & helpful?

> - Is the review process transparent & timely

> - Are the reviews collegial & helpful?


## Choosing a journal | Impact Factor (IF)

* Frequency with which the *average article* in a journal has been cited in a particular year or period

> - IF's can be used to approximate the prestige of journals

> -  Many people, including search & tenure committees, pay close attention to journal IF's


## Choosing a journal | Impact Factor (IF)

Number of citations in year *t* divided by total publications during the previous two years

$$
\text{IF}_t = \frac{citations_t}{pubs_{t-1} + pubs_{t-2}}
$$

## Choosing a journal | Author guidelines

* article type & length

> - section names & requirements

> - formatting of references, tables & figures

> - for example, [Can J Fish Aquat Sci](https://cdnsciencepub.com/journal/cjfas/authors)


## Choosing a journal | Publishing costs

Page charges vary widely among journals; options include

* OA (anyone can access) = higher flat rate 

> - journal subscribers = lower flat rate (+ color figures)

> - membership (eg, [*PeerJ*](https://peerj.com/pricing/#pay-with-lifetime-membership))

> - some are free (eg, [*Can J Fish Aquat Sci*](https://cdnsciencepub.com/authors-and-reviewers/publication-fees))
