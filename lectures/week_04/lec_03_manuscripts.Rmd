## Science is a process

* Publishing is part of the process

> - The general flow goes something like the following


## Process of publishing 

A. Someone takes the lead

> - Point person for communication

> - Keeps others on task and on time


## Process of publishing 

B. Co-authors are chosen<sup>*</sup>

> - Begin this process **early**

> - Communication is key

> - Consult journal guidelines

> - Err on the side of inclusion

> - Value diversity

> - Document contributions


## Process of publishing 

2. A journal is chosen based upon

> - topic

> - audience

> - reputation or impact factor

> - cost


## Process of publishing 

3. Tasks are assigned

> - may involve analysis, production of figures & tables, writing


## Process of publishing 

3. Leader drafts an outline, decides how to focus it, chooses an appropriate target journal (or vice versa)

Drafts get circulated among all co-authors

The final version is uploaded to a journal’s website (pick a journal and explore this process – it is not trivial)

## Manuscript structure | 3 important pieces

1. Title

2. Abstract

3. Body

    - text / narrative  
    - figures / tables  
    - references  
    

## Manuscript structure | Title

* Must get the attention of a wide but appropriate range of potential readers.

> - Who is the target audience? Related to species, region, habitat, taxa?

> - Need not be formal but avoid getting too cute

> - Pros and cons of being specific and general

> - Consider a rough title to help think about the proposal & then refine it later


## Manuscript structure | Abstract

* As with a scientific paper, it should include elements of

    - introduction  
    - methods  
    - (anticipated) results  
    - discussion  
    
> - Focus on introduction & interpretation

> - Should convey that project is **important & do-able**


## Manuscript structure | Body

* Introduction  

> - Materials & methods  

> - Results

> - Discussion
